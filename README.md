### Goal: Write your own “documentation” for the higher order functions
**Your documentation should include:**
- A description of the purpose
- A description of the syntax
- An example
- An explanation of the example
- Any additional notes/details

Your documentation here: 

## Higher Order Functions 

** Higher Order Functions ** are functions that accept other functions as an argument. We often use higher order functions in order to abstract over actions.

```js
//sayMyName is a function that will return the 
function sayMyName(str, showMyName()){
  let name = "";
  
  const showMyName str2 => {
    console.log();
  }
  
  for(let i = 0; i <= str.length; i++){
    name += str[i];
  }
  
  showMyName(name)
}
```
